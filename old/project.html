        <h1>OUR PROJECT</h1>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Governments and private enterprises alike are gearing up for travel across our Solar System. Plans to colonize nearby
            planets are underway, with Elon Musk spearheading the initiative to put a human colony on Mars by 2030. In a
            parallel vein, NASA is planning a manned exploratory mission to Mars as soon as the 2030s. Several other space
            agencies have similar plans and timelines for their own respective Mars explorations. This exciting time in our
            history nonetheless comes with the challenges of long-term space travel.
            <br>
            <br>Waste management on Mars will be paramount because manned missions will need to recover as much water and oxygen
            as possible to sustain life. Human waste must also be treated to minimize health risks for the crew of a Mars
            mission. All of this must be accomplished while preserving the natural Martian environment.
            <br>
            <br>The current cost of shipping materials up to space is $10,000 USD per pound due to the high price of fuel (Hsu,
            2011). This expense will constrain early Mars mission crews in the supplies that they can bring or ship from
            Earth to Mars, and may not allow astronauts to account for every tool they may require during their mission.
            One way to mitigate this challenge is to develop a system to produce necessary items in space as needs arise.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Our team is working on a unique solution to both of the aforementioned challenges of future Mars missions: we intend
            to upcycle human waste by using it as a feedstock for E. coli engineered to produce bioplastic, which can then
            be 3D printed into useful tools onsite.
            <br>
            <br>Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a bioplastic, is produced in nature by many bacterial species. Literature has
            shown that PHB can be produced using a variety of feedstocks, including glucose and volatile fatty acids (VFAs)
            (Albuquerque et al., 2011). Since human waste contains both glucose and VFAs, it is a potentially useful feedstock
            for PHB production.
            <br>
            <br>Our team engineered E. coli to express PHB-producing genes, which we codon-optimized to increase the efficiency
            of PHB production. We then modified native E. coli secretion pathways so the cells would release the PHB they
            produced. This allows for a continuous PHB production and secretion process, as opposed to a traditional batch
            process, which is not user-friendly and requires more time and maintenance. When employed together, these genetic
            modifications create a novel means of bioplastic production.
            <br>
            <br>We also developed a start-to-finish process involving both waste management and PHB production. In the first
            step of this process, solid human waste is collected and fermented with naturally occurring enterogenic bacteria
            to increase the concentration of VFAs. As a part of this process, the solids from the waste settle and the liquid
            rises to the surface of the fermentation tank. Next, the VFA-concentrated liquid in the fermentation tank is
            separated from the solid particles by centrifugation, sterilized by filtration, and passed to a bioreactor containing
            our engineered PHB-producing E. coli. Once the PHB is synthesized and secreted, it can be continuously collected
            and extracted from the liquid stream. The resulting liquid can be recycled into drinking water, while PHB particles
            can be used in a Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printer to generate items useful to astronauts.</p>
