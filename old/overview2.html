                    Gene therapy gives us the opportunity to add, remove, and change our genes, influencing how protiens are made and better
                    provide care for those who suffer from debilitating diseases.

                Typically, gene therapy is performed using a virus to introduce the treatment into the body. Viruses are greatly successful
                at penetrating cells, and thus work as an excellent vector for introducing genetic material. Provided that
                the treatment is successful, functioning proteins will be secreted from the repaired cell, as diagrammed
                below.

            How We're Moving Towards a Safer Gene Therapy

        <div class="row info">
            <p>
                While viral vectors have successfully demonstrated the potential of gene therapy, safety concerns, such as the random integration
                of therapeutic DNA, which can lead to cancer and severe immune responses, constrain their use to severe diseases.
                In order for gene therapies to benefit a greater number of people, for a wider range of indications, the
                risks of viral delivery must be overcome.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row info">
            <p>
                Targeted integration of DNA in mammalian genomes has been made simple with CRISPR/Cas9. Unfortunately, the insertion of large
                (> 1 kb) DNA inserts has proven too inefficient for therapeutic applications, restricting the use of CRISPR-mediated
                knock-in to relatively small inserts. In light of these constraints, the University of Calgary iGEM team
                has designed a targeted gene integration platform to build a safer gene therapy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 info">
                <p>
                    There are two pillars at the core of our platform. The first consists of a two-phase integration system, based on CRISPR/Cas9
                    and Flp recombinase. By inserting small Flp recombinase target (FRT) sites using CRISPR/Cas9, Flp can
                    be used to integrate large inserts. To minimize the risk of off-target effects, we will target a "genomic
                    safe harbor" where DNA can safely be introduced.

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 info">
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we are minimizing off-target integration by employing Cas9 nickase with an ssDNA template. This second pillar
                    leverages regulatory elements (REs) found naturally in the human genome to keep therapeutic DNA active
                    and isolated from its genomic context. In particular, we are using ubiquitously-acting chromatin-opening
                    elements (UCOEs) to maintain internal control of transgene expression, while preventing disruption of
                    the host genome with insulators.

                    As a relatively new treatment, gene therapy has been met with mixed reactions. Concerns range from the
                    ethics of enhancement to the accessibility of the treatment. The team would like to address two specific
                    concerns: the act of playing god with respect to western religions, and the relationship between gene
                    therapy treatments and traditional First Nations medicine practices.
