<h1> Safety </h1>
<p>Please visit the <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Safety">Safety Hub</a> to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.</p>

<p>On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can <strong>go beyond the questions on the safety forms</strong>, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)</p>
